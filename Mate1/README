STEPS TO RUN THE PROJECT:
(a) THERE ARE 8 JAR FILES IN THE PROJECT, EACH INTENDED TO RUN A TEST CASE AS GIVEN IN THE "TEST_CASES_ALL.XLSX" FILE.
(B) DOWNLOAD ALL THE JAR FILES IN A LOCAL DIRECTORY.
(C) REACH THE DIRECTORY USING COMMAND PROMPT.
(D) TYPE "java -jar MATE1.TC1.jar" TO RUN TEST CASE 1 (TC1). SIMILARLY TO RUN 2ND TEST CASE USE COMMAND "java -jar MATE1.TC2.jar", AND SO ON AND SO FORTH.
(E) THE OUTPUT FOR EACH TEST WILL BE VISIBLE IN THE CONSOLE IN THE FORM OF TEXTS DISPLAYING SUMMARY OF THE TEST.

LIST OF FEATURES IMPLEMENTED
(A) 8 TEST CASES COMPRISING OF VARIOUS TEST SCENARIOS WERE IMPLEMENTED. SOME REPETITIVE TEST CASES WERE AVOIDED TO KEEP THE NUMBER OF TEST CASES MINIMAL.
(B) IN SHORT, ALL THE FIELDS AND LINKS ON THE WAY TO CREATING, VIEWING AND EDITING A PROFILE WAS TESTED.
(C) WHILE VIEWING DETAILS OF A MINI PROFILE, IT WAS CHECKED IF THE DETAILS MATCHED THE DETAILS FED WHILE CREATING THE PROFILE
(D) WHILE EDITING A PROFILE, IT WAS TESTED WHETHER THE CHANGE IS VISIBLE TO THE USER ONCE THE CHANGES ARE SAVED.
(E) IT WAS ALSO TESTED WHETHER ILLEGAL STRINGS IN "ABOUT ME" AND "WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR" FIELDS ARE STRIPPED OFF OR NOT, ONCE USER SAVES THE CHANGES
(F) IN THE CODE A "shuffleEmail()" METHOD IS INTRODUCED TO MAKE USE OF RANDOMLY GENERATED STRINGS AS INPUT EMAIL ADDRESS. THIS WOULD REMOVE THE ISSUE OF USING AN ALREADY REGISTERED EMAIL ADDRESS TWICE, ONCE A NEW TEST IS LAUCHED.
